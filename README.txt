# Summary
Simple text-based Mastermind game using Python libraries and File I/O developed for Fall 2021 Principles of Computing Science I class at Ithaca College.

# Original Description
Traditionally, Mastermind is a two-player game in which one player creates a
code using colored pegs, secret to the other player. It is then up to the other
player to guess the correct code in a set number of attempts.

In this game, codes are instead generated randomly, and your task is to find
the correct code within a preset number of turns. It is also customizable
so you can choose whether you want to play with colors or numbers 1-10,
the length of the hidden code, and whether the same color/number can be in
multiple places in the code at once.

Simply follow the prompts on screen to get started.

GAMEPLAY TIPS:


Hits and Blows:

Hits: when you guess the correct color or number in the right position, that is hit.

Blows: when you guess the correct color or number in the wrong position, that is a blow.
